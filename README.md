# Book Recommendation Engine using KNN

This project implements a book recommendation engine using the Nearest Neighbors unsupervised learning algorithm. It was developed as part of a challenge on Freecodecamp.

## Overview

The goal of this project was to create a recommendation algorithm using the Nearest Neighbors algorithm, leveraging the Book-Crossings dataset. This dataset comprises 1.1 million ratings (on a scale of 1-10) of 270,000 books by 90,000 users.

## Author

This project was authored by Alina Yildirim.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset

The Book-Crossings dataset used in this project contains extensive information on user ratings for various books. This dataset is instrumental in training the recommendation engine to provide accurate suggestions based on user preferences.

## Implementation

The implementation is done in Python, utilizing Jupyter Notebook for interactive development and visualization. The Nearest Neighbors algorithm is employed to analyze user ratings and recommend books based on similarities between users' preferences.

## Usage

To use this recommendation engine, simply execute the provided code in Jupyter Notebook environment after downloading the dataset. Follow the instructions within the notebook to understand the workings of the algorithm and to receive book recommendations based on your input.
